What To Do Next
---------------


Hmmm...wondering what you should add in the next commit?


TheRealM3TR0 suggests:

*Make some custom tiles for Enemy Territory. I am the worst texture artist in the world.

*Add in some more story.

*Work out an ending plan.

*Add your own suggestions down here when you think of some yourself!


---THAT'S ALL FOR NOW---

Are you ready to commit now?
